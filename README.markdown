Thank you for providing the detailed documentation for your Mock Interview Platform and the updated `test_score_answers.py`. The documentation outlines the project’s structure, setup, and functionality, focusing on the `/get_questions` and `/score_answers` endpoints. However, it does not cover the `/score_answers` endpoint’s handling of coding problems, which is critical given your previous issue where coding problems (`coding_problem:1` and `coding_problem:2`) scored 0.0/2.5 with no debug output, as seen in `test_score_answers_all_languages.py`. Your latest request for JSON data to test the `/get_questions` endpoint and the provided documentation suggest you’re now testing theory questions only (8 DevOps questions) in `test_score_answers.py`, but the project supports coding problems as well.

I’ll update the documentation to:
1. Incorporate the `/get_questions` endpoint details based on your request and the provided JSON payload.
2. Reflect the handling of both theory and coding questions, aligning with `test_score_answers_all_languages.py` and the `coding_problem.csv` from previous responses.
3. Update the requirements to match your latest `requirements.txt` and include `pymongo` for MongoDB connectivity.
4. Address the scoring issue for `devops:148` and the lack of debug output for coding problems.
5. Provide JSON data for testing `/get_questions` and `/score_answers` for both theory and coding questions.
6. Include a troubleshooting section for the coding problem issue.

The updated documentation will be concise, incorporate all changes, and use Python code blocks (```python) as requested, avoiding external notebooks.

# Mock Interview Platform Documentation

## 1. Project Overview
The Mock Interview Platform is a FastAPI-based web application designed to simulate technical interviews for roles such as DevOps, Machine Learning Engineer, Backend, and others. It retrieves role-specific questions (theory and coding) from a MongoDB database (`interview_db`) and scores user answers using semantic similarity with the **Sentence-BERT (SBERT) `all-mpnet-base-v2`** model, with a TF-IDF fallback or **SBERT `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`** for resource-constrained environments. The platform provides detailed feedback to help candidates improve, targeting a maximum score of 15 (10 for 8 theory questions, 5 for 2 coding problems). The latest score for theory questions was 7.39/10, with `devops:148` needing refinement (missing concepts: "systems, tolerance, traffic"). Coding problems currently score 0.0/5 due to missing MongoDB data or execution issues.

### Key Features
- **Question Retrieval**: Fetches 8 theory questions (e.g., `devops:179`) and 2 coding problems (e.g., `coding_problem:1`) per request from MongoDB based on `role`, `level`, and `company`.
- **Answer Scoring**:
  - Theory: Scores 8 answers (0–1.25 each, total 10) using SBERT `all-mpnet-base-v2` for semantic similarity.
  - Coding: Scores 2 problems (0–2.5 each, total 5) by executing code against 5 test cases per problem.
- **Feedback**: Suggests missing concepts (e.g., "systems, tolerance, traffic" for `devops:148`) for low-scoring answers (< 0.3 similarity) and test case results for coding problems.
- **Data Management**: Loads questions from CSV files (e.g., `devops.csv`, `coding_problem.csv`) into MongoDB.
- **Configuration**: Uses a `.env` file (e.g., `SCORING_METHOD=sbert`).

### Objectives
- Simulate real-world technical interviews with theory and coding questions.
- Provide accurate semantic-based scoring and actionable feedback.
- Support multiple roles (DevOps, Machine Learning Engineer, etc.) and difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).
- Achieve scores of 12–14/15 with refined answers and correct code submissions.

  similarity = util.cos_sim(embeddings[0], embeddings[1]).item()
  score = similarity * 1.25  # Scale to 1.25 for theory
  ```
- **Thresholds**:
  - < 0.3: "Needs significant improvement."
  - 0.3–0.5: "Partially correct."
  - ≥ 0.5: "Good answer."

### 6.2 Sentence-BERT `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (Alternative Model)
#### Overview

## 9. Troubleshooting
### Low Score for `devops:148`
- **Issue**: Previously scored ~0.3, now improved to ~0.968 (7.74/8 total).
- **Check Reference Answer**:
  ```javascript
  use interview_db
  db.devops.findOne({"id": "148"}).answer
  ```
- **Update Answer**:
  ```json
  "System design in DevOps is critical for building fault-tolerant, scalable systems that ensure high availability and efficient traffic distribution. It supports microservices architecture, automates CI/CD pipelines, and integrates observability for performance monitoring."
  ```

### Coding Problems Scoring 0.0
- **Issue**: All test cases fail for `coding_problem:1` and `coding_problem:2`, no debug output.
- **Cause**: Likely empty `coding_problem` collection or code execution failure.
- **Check MongoDB**:
  ```javascript
  use interview_db
  db.coding_problem.find({"id": {$in: ["1", "2"]}}).pretty()
  ```
- **Reload Data**:
  ```python
  from services.database_service import load_csv_to_mongo
  load_csv_to_mongo()
  ```
- **Test Code Execution**:
  ```python
  from services.scoring_service import evaluate_test_case
  code = "def sum_array(arr):\n    return sum(arr)"
  test_case = "{\"input\": \"[1,2,3]\", \"output\": \"6\"}"
  print(evaluate_test_case(code, test_case, "python"))
  ```

### Duplicate Questions
- **Check**:
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  df = pd.read_csv("data/devops.csv")
  print(df[df["question"].duplicated(keep=False)][["id", "question"]])
  ```
- **Remove**:
  ```python
  df = df.drop_duplicates(subset="question", keep="first")
  df.to_csv("data/devops.csv", index=False)
  from services.database_service import load_csv_to_mongo
  load_csv_to_mongo()
  ```

### Missing Debug Output
- **Check Logs**:
  ```bash
  cat server.log
  ```
- **Enable Debug**:
  ```bash
  export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
  python main.py
  ```

## 10. Enhancements
1. **Embedding Caching**:
   ```python
   embedding_cache = {}
   def get_embedding(text):
       if text not in embedding_cache:
           embedding_cache[text] = sbert_model.encode(text, convert_to_tensor=True)
       return embedding_cache[text]
   ```

2. **Score Storage**:
   ```python
   from datetime import datetime
   db.user_scores.insert_one({
       "timestamp": datetime.now(),
       "ids": request.id,
       "answers": request.answers,
       "code_submissions": request.code_submissions,
       "language": request.language,
       "score": final_score,
       "feedback": "\n".join(feedback)
   })
   ```

3. **GPU Acceleration**:
   ```python
   sbert_model = SentenceTransformer('all-mpnet-base-v2', device='cuda')
   ```

## 11. Notes
- **Empty Array Handling**: `max_element([])` returns `0` as per `coding_problem.csv`.
- **Latest Issue**: Coding problems score 0.0 due to missing `coding_problem` data or execution errors. Debug using `server.log` and MongoDB queries.
- **Next Steps**: Test `/get_questions` and `/score_answers` with provided JSON, share outputs.

---

### Changes Made
1. **Updated Endpoints**: Added `/get_questions` details with JSON payload and test script.
2. **Included Coding Problems**: Reflected support for 2 coding problems in `/get_questions` and `/score_answers`, addressing the 0.0 score issue.
3. **Updated Requirements**: Aligned with your latest `requirements.txt` and added `pymongo`, `requests`, `tqdm`, `numpy`.
4. **Troubleshooting**: Added steps for coding problem issues and missing debug output.
5. **Scoring Details**: Clarified total score (15) with theory (10) and coding (5) breakdown.
6. **Test Scripts**: Included both `test_score_answers.py` (theory) and `test_score_answers_all_languages.py` (theory + coding).

### Next Steps
1. Save JSON payloads and test scripts.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   python test_get_questions.py
   python test_score_answers_all_languages.py
   ```
3. Share:
   - MongoDB output:
     ```javascript
     db.coding_problem.find({"id": {$in: ["1", "2"]}}).pretty()
     db.devops.find({"id": {$in: ["179", "117", "173", "127", "1", "60", "148", "195"]}}).pretty()
     ```
   - Test outputs and `server.log`.
4. Confirm additional endpoints or specific issues.
